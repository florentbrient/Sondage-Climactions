In our lab, huge efforts must be made to obtain minor reductions. Whereas, if people from the lab carried this message to countries with large emissions (that are needless), we can achieve a much larger reduction, more quickly. For example, Lebanon has large emissions due to garbage burning by citizens, outside in the open. If a facility is established in each region to regulate this burning, we obtain an immense reduction immediately. It is good to note that such activities directly affect Europe, as carbon crosses the Mediterranean's atmosphere."

Besides, this problem is a complex one, and should concern way more people in the lab than only Climaction. Times of debate like the upcoming General Assembly could be more frequent in order to fully grasp the issue and its declinations at the lab scale (it can also be specific workshops)"
